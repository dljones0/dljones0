I'm a digital-signal-processing electrical/computer engineer with particular interests in biological and bio-inspired applications.  During research collaborations with biologists and neuroscientists, I've created unique software for

* locating and separating the calls of multiple animals in a large natural chorus.

* analyzing and synthesizing action potential (spike train) sequences with biologically accurate timing.

The ultimate goal is to develop uniquely capable and usable software packages enabling biologists to address new research questions which have never before been possible.


**PROFESSIONAL BIOGRAPHY**

_Douglas L. Jones_ received the BSEE, MSEE, and Ph.D. degrees from Rice University in 1983, 1986, and 1987, respectively. During the 1987â€“1988 academic year, he was with the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany on a Fulbright Postdoctoral Fellowship. Since 1988, he has been with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL, USA, where he is currently an Emeritus Professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Neuroscience, the Coordinated Science Laboratory, and the Beckman Institute. In the Spring semester of 1999, he served as the Texas Instruments Visiting Professor with Rice University. He served as Director of the Advanced Digital Sciences Center in Singapore from 2010 to 2014. His research interests are in digital signal processing, including nonstationary signal analysis, adaptive processing, multisensor data processing, machine learning, OFDM, and various applications such as low-power implementations, biology and neuroengineering, and advanced hearing aids and other audio systems. He is an author of two DSP laboratory textbooks, and was selected as the 2003 Connexions Author of the Year. He served on the Board of Governors of the IEEE Signal Processing Society from 2002-2004.
